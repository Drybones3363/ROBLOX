Project Started: <b>January, 2016</b><br>
Project Ended: <b>Unfinished</b>

A game where you collect limiteds and invest. What makes it better than all the others is it uses the normal curve and statistics to determine if computer players will buy your limited with the given demand, at a set price. (so they will snipe an item for R$50 right away, but would almost never buy an item for R$10M+)
